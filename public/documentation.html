    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      myFlixApp is a movie web application that provides users with access to
      information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users are able
      to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their
      favorite movies.
      <br />
      For that purpose a REST API was created that interacts with a movie
      database.
